# DaCardConv
A simple tool to convert a CardDAV-address-book into a text-based file, which can be imported into Phoner.exe

## Currently in Development
some features are still missing like:

- directly retrieve contacts from CardDAV-Server
- support for PhonerLite
- more options for formatting
- creating stand-alone application (currently runs in IDE only)
